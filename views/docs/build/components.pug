      h1.display-3 Build a component
      p Learn the basics using our development tools: the Fliplet CLI
  .container
    p To start creating a component, use the Fliplet CLI to generate a boilerplate including the basic things you'll need:

    .card
      .card-header
        pre.
          $ fliplet create-widget "my-awesome-component"

    br

    p The above code will create a new folder named "my-awesome-component" including the skeleton of your component, including these files:

    ul
      li
        strong css/
      li
        strong img/
      li js/interface.js
      li widget.json
      li interface.html
      li build.html

    p To run your component, simply navigate to its folder and use the <kbd>run</kbd> command:

    .card
      .card-header
        pre.
          cd my-awesome-component
          fliplet run

    br
    p The above command will run the development server at <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a>. The local development server uses sample data to speed up your development, so you don't have to worry about creating apps, screens, data, etc.
    p We'll first focus on the <kbd>widget.json</kbd>, which is the definition file of your component. If you're used to npm, it's similar to the <code>package.json</code> file for npm modules.

    p.alert.alert-warning
      strong Including external libraries:
      |  Components should never include script or link tags to reference external assets (like <strong>vendor libraries</strong>), but rather define them as assets via the widget.json file. Check the section below for more details.
    br
    hr
    br
    h2 The component definition file

    p The <kbd>widget.json</kbd> file defines your component as well as the <strong>dependencies</strong> and <strong>assets</strong> it needs in order to run.

    .card
      .card-body
        pre.
          {
            "name": "my Awesome Component",
            "package": "com.example.my-awesome-component",
            "dependencies": [],
            "assets": []
          }

    br
    p.alert.alert-warning Please note: if you make changes to the <kbd>widget.json</kbd> file, restart the development server (<code>fliplet run</code>) to apply the changes you made.

    h2 Instances

    p Once a component is dropped onto a page (or an app component is added as an add-on), an instance of such component will be created in the system for the app.

    p A component instance (internally called <strong>Widget Instance</strong>) can save settings for the instance of the component.

    p Components can save their settings through our <strong>JS APIs</strong> (available via the <kbd>fliplet-core</kbd> package):

    .card
      .card-body
        pre.
          Fliplet.Widget.save({
            someValue: true,
            otherValue: 1,
            supportsObjects: {
              a: 'Hello',
              b: 'World'
            }
          });

    br
    p.alert.alert-info As you can see, plain Javascript objects (which can be serialized to <strong>JSON</strong>) are supported.

    hr

    h2 Components studio interface and screen output

    p All components can define a <strong>html interface</strong> to be displayed in Fliplet Studio where their settings for the instance can be configured. An interface (<kbd>interface.html</kbd>) is made of a HTML page (which is compiled via Handlebars from the engine) and additional assets (JS, CSS, etc).

    p In addition, both <strong>app and page components</strong> should also define a <strong>html output</strong> (the <kbd>build.html</kbd> file) to be displayed in the page when they are dropped in.

    p Therefore, to recap:

    ul
      li
        strong
          a(href='components/interface') interface.html
        |  defines the interface for app components, page components and providers
      li
        strong
          a(href='components/output') build.html
        |  defines the output of an app or page component

    hr

    h3 Sample interface.html

    .card
      .card-body
        pre.
          &lt;form&gt;
            &lt;input type="text" name="videoUrl" value="{{ videoUrl }}" placeholder="A video url" /&gt;
          &lt;/form&gt;
